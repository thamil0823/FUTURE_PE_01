TITLE: What REALLY Happens When You Buy Crypto?

HOOK:
Have you ever clicked the “Buy” button on a crypto app and wondered
where your money actually goes? Let’s break it down simply.

INTRO:
If you’re new to crypto, don’t worry.
You don’t need any technical knowledge.
In the next one minute, I’ll explain what really happens
when you buy cryptocurrency.

MAIN EXPLANATION:
First, you open a crypto app and choose a coin.
You enter the amount and click Buy.

Your payment is checked and approved.
Then the system finds someone who is selling the same coin.

Once matched, the crypto moves to your account.
At the same time, the ownership is updated and recorded securely.

All of this happens in seconds,
even though it looks very simple on your screen.

OUTRO:
So next time you buy crypto, remember —
you’re not just clicking a button.
There’s a secure process working behind the scenes.
